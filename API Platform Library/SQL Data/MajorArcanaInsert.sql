The Foolish Man stands with his worldly belongings at the edge of a precipice, ignorant of the lashing waves and the crocodile with open jaws. The Foolish Man holds in his right hand the rose of joy, signifyting perfect innocence and he holds a fierce wolf in check by a leash. Behind him sprouts the flower of silence.

The snake-like creatures that issue from beneath the crest are similar to those found in the Caduceus held by the radiating figure of Mercury to the left of the card. The Magician is seen as a communicator with the gods and the storer of knowledge which he willingly dispenses, similar to Mercury who, in mythology, is the winged messenger of the gods. Thus the Magician, through his actions and exhibition of will, can bring unity between the divine, intellectual, and physical worlds. by intelligence, the idea of God is conceived, and by willpower, works of good nature are accomplished. The altar at his feet contains the symbols of the four suits; swords, wands (represented as a dagger), cups, and the image of a pentagram on a book.

The High Priestess holds upon her knee a book, partially concealed by her mantle, which holds the truth behind the veil of feminine light. At her breast, she holds a lyre, the alw of Artemis, for she is also a Huntress and, like Diana, she hunts by enchantment. This card rules the path of the camel that runs from Kether to Tiphareth on the Tree of Life. This same path runs between the two gigantic pillars beside the throne upon which The High Priestess is majestically seated. The High Priestess controls the energy of life between the two pillars that are topped by spiraling pinnacles. At the bottom of the card are the large spheres of her throne.

Overkindness. Unorthodox. Frail. Vulnerable.','The seated figure wears the papal tiara. The elephant is of the nature of Taurus and symbolizes the strength of the Hierophant"s foundation. The star-shaped figure at the top of the card is the monogram of Hermetic Truth and also represents the seal of the macrocosm.

At the bottom of the card are the cosmic egg and a shaft of wheat, dormant for years, but easy to nurture to life at the opportune time.

Failure to give of one"s self. False prophecy.','The inverted ankh is in harmony with the inverted man. The ankh and the rose cross symbolize the supreme formula of adeptness and the sacrifice that has to be undertaken to complete any great work. The inverted figure forms a cross upon an equilateral triangle, representing the descent of light into darkness. The serpent on the right foot suggests both creator and destroyer. The symbol for water appears at the left center and the symbol for Neptune at the right center.'),

The glyph of Capricorn is represented on the left and the sign of Scoprpio on the right. In the upper background a volcano erupts and its ash forms a rainbow extending toward earth. The angel of occult wisdom wears a crown of gold and pours water from the cup of white gluten into the cauldron. The leopard-faced cauldron is symbolic of fire. The fire burns along the water and the water extinguishes the fire. Thus, fire and water mix harmoniously, fanned by the slow circulation of air created by the slowly flapping wings of the birds. To the left and right of the vessel are the triangular symbols for water and fire respectively. The marriage of fire and water, Shin and Qopa, is held by power of Saturn and concentrated by Mars.

Loneliness.','Beneath a fiery sun, two children dance wildly and roses appear between them and behind each of them. The roses represent the flowering of the solar influence. The dancing sirens are young, shameless, and innocent. The sun and its heat are a beneficent source of life, and a melter of the waxen wings of ambition and curiosity. The sun radiates upon the children. It is Heru-Ra-Ha, Lord of the New Aeon.'),
